Huly Code is our integrated development environment (IDE) based on [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Community Edition. We are developing it to research efficient collaboration between humans and AI agents in software development.

Soon, Huly Code will optionally integrate with Huly Platform to provide a seamless experience for developers working together.

Huly Code is an advanced IDE in its own right, with advanced code navigation, code completion, and code analysis features.
Instead of proprietary JetBrains plugins, Huly Code uses open-source software.
Huly Code works with modern [Language Servers](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), such as [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) and many others.

Huly Code is also high-performance, utilizing native open-source components such as [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io) for syntax highlighting and code analysis.
As a result, Huly Code is a modern IDE that is fast, reliable, and comparable to the best IDEs in the industry. And of course, it is open-source and free to use.
